## Hitboxer — Sprite Sheet hitbox creation tool.

Hitboxer is a desktop tool built with Electron, React, and TypeScript designed for artists, developers, and modders who need a fast, clean way to create hitboxes, edit them with an abundance of stats & data, and export results as a JSON file ready to be parsed by a game engine.

It supports independent scrolling panels, color-coded metadata, dynamic UI scaling, a buttload of settings, and a focused layout for productivity.

Hitboxer was built out of the frustration a lot of fellow game developers run into when making 2D games and dealing with 2D art animations, be they drawn HD or pixel art, and that's the creation, managing, and usage of hitboxes.

In my case I—like others—was exporting JSON Aseprite spritesheet data and using their "slice" tool as a bootleg hitbox outline so that it could be parsed by our game engines. but it was an absolute positioning from the origin for the dimensions of the hitbox and not relative to ITS specific frame; this pretty much ruined the entire experience for me, and Aseprite seems to have forgotten about the community's requests.

I looked around and found others who created something similar to what I'm making now, but most of their projects are out-of-date builds, and I wanted to create an updated version for the people.

So with that, I truly hope you enjoy Hitboxer!
